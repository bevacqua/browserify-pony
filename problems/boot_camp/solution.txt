Here's the reference solution:

  console.log('PONY FOO');

We piped the output of browserify into the verify command directly, but
ordinarily to use browserify in your page you would do:

  browserify pony_foo.js > bundle.js

Then in your html, you just add a single <script> tag:

  <script src='bundle.js'></script>

We'll be taking this a step further in the next few challenges.
