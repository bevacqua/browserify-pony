Here's the reference solution:

  var estimate = require('estimate');
  var moment = require('moment');

  function approximate (data) {
    var seconds = estimate.text(String(data));
    var human = moment.duration(seconds, 'seconds').humanize();
    return 'That should take you approximately ' + human + ' to read';
  }

  module.exports = approximate;

There are lots of ways to complete this level, so your solution might look
quite different!

By exporting a reusable function, you allow other modules to easily consume
it from anywhere in your app. This is the basis of a healthy and modular
codebase built on top of Browserify.
